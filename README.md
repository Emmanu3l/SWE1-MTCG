**Protocol:**

Oct 13. 2020:
Initial commit
~2 hour to set up the environment

Oct 17. & 26. 2020:
Some adjustments to the overall structure of the project.
If I recall correctly, this is when I created most of the Classes for the mtcg Project,
in order to generate a class diagram with IntelliJ.
~2 hours

Oct 27. - 30. 2020:
Begin working on the client server application.
~10 hours to acquire knowledge about client server applications.

Nov 13. - 21. 2020:
This is where I did the bulk of the work for the Server.
I worked on it around 5 hours a day for 8 days, therefore I estimate,
that I spent around 30 hours on the project during that time.

Nov 22., 24. Dec 2:
Small changes after submitting the client server application.
I mainly fixed small things that I (of course) only noticed after submitting my work.
I also changed the file type for the messages from list to dictionary.
If I recall correctly, the changes made by me during this time fixed *some*
of the errors I got when working with Postman and Insomnia, but not all of them.
I also tested my application some more with cURL.
I decided to carry on with the mtcg part of the project before revisiting these errors,
which seemed to be mostly encoding related.
~5 hours

Dec 26 -:
Continued working on the mtcg project.
